SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
=====================

To participate in class you will have to install Navicat for MySQL or MySQL
Workshop.  These are "client" programs that will allow you to connect to and
work on a MySQL database server that I host for the class.

A client program is not a database program per se.  It is a program that
connects to a database server for the purpose of sending queries for execution
and receiving the output of those queries.  If you would like to install a
server of your own -- and I strongly recommend that you do -- instructions for
this are provided below.  Note that people often do have some
not-insurmountable difficulties with this installation (particularly on
Windows).  If you do have trouble, remember, all you need for the class is the
client.  Get that installed and I'll try to help you with the server
installation during class breaks.

Recently Windows users seem to have installed Navicat more smoothly than
Workbench.  Your mileage may vary.


CLIENTS
=======

Navicat for MySQL
-----------------
Navicat offers a free trial version of their MySQL database client for Mac OSX,
Windows and Linux.  You can download this for your computer at this link:
http://www.navicat.com/download/navicat-for-mysql.  Open the file and follow
the instructions there for installation.

Note that Navicat offers clients for a number of different SQL databases:
Postgres, SQL Server, etc.  Take care to get a client for MySQL.


MySQL Workbench
---------------
The people who maintain MySQL also offer a free client, MySQL Workbench, with
versions for Mac OSX, Windows and Linux.  You can download the appropriate
version from www.mysql.com/products/workbench.


SERVER
======

Again: This is not necessary for class, so if you can't do it before Friday,
don't worry.  You should, however, eventually install a server of your own so
you can work with SQL on your own with the need for someone else's server.

The MySQL server can be installed to Mac, Windows and Linux from downloads from
mysql.com.  You will need to install the following items:

-   MySQL Server (www.mysql.com/downloads/, look for "MySQL Community Server")
-   A script that starts up the MySQL server when the computer is started
    -   For Macs, this script is in the same installer package as the Server
        (named MySQLStartupItem.pkg)

Instructions are provided on the website.  I add some notes below.

You are successfully installed if you can run MySQL Workbench and get a 'SQL
Editor' tab on clicking the 'Open Connection to Starty Querying' box, and
then clicking 'OK'.


MACINTOSH
---------
For Macs that means dowloading two different packages, and installing two
pieces of software from them.  Please take care to download the .dmg files,
rather than the .tar files, the former should be much easier to install.

BE CAREFUL ABOUT VERSIONS.  Verify that the version you download is compatible
with the version of your OS.

USE DMG FILES.  Macintosh users should please take care to download the .dmg
installation files from the site, rather than the .tar files.  The .dmg files
provide an automated installation path, which should lead you through the whole
process.

Once all that is installed, restart your computer.  You should then be able to
create a database connection with Workbench (or Navicat, which ever you've
installed).
-   Open Workbench
-   Click "Open Connection to Start Querying"
    name for the connection, anything will do.
-   A dialog box ("Connect to Database") opens.  Click "OK".  A window titled
    "MySQL Workbench", with a tab labeled "SQL Editor 0", should open.
-   At this point you can setup the sample database we'll be using in class.
    Please see the instructions and files in the directory data.


============================
Troubleshooting -- Macintosh
============================
You (think you have) followed the installations instructions but it doesn't
work.

Check Version Compatability
---------------------------
-   You must install a MySQL version appropriate for your OS version.
-   The OS version can be found by:
    -   Clicking the Apple icon at the top left of the Desktop screen
    -   Clicking "About This Mac"
    -   An info box appears in the middle of your screen, the version number of
        your OS can be found there
-   The MySQL version can be found in the name of the file you downloaded from
    mysql.com
    -   That file is probably somewhere in Downloads/
    -   Its name will include the string 'mysql'
    -   The target OS version is in that file name.
        -   For example, << mysql-5.5.12-osx10.6-x86_64.dmg >> is intended for
            OSX 10.6, 64 bit.
        -   If the MySQL package targets an OS version above yours, it won't
            work on yours
        -   If MySQL package targets an OS version under yours, it might or
            might not work
        -   I haven't seen issues with 64 bit versus 32 bit
            -   Though if in doubt, 32 bit would work for both, so using that
                is surest

Check If Server Is Running
--------------------------
-   Open Activity Monitor
    -   Applications > Utilities > Activity Monitor
-   Look for the process 'mysqld'
    1   Sort by "Process Name" by clicking "Process Name" in the displayed
        table, scroll down looking for 'mysqld'
    
    or

    2   In the 'filter' box, type 'mysql' or 'mysqld'
        -   mysqld should appear in the results

-   IF 'mysqld' doesn't appear:
    -   The server program wasn't installed, AND / OR
    -   The server startup script wasn't installed, AND / OR
    -   The computer wasn't reboot after installation of those items

    Carefully review and repeat those installations, restart the computer, and
    recheck for the 'mysqld' process



WINDOWS
-------
mysql.com has similar downloads for Windows.  Unfortunately I am less familiar
with Windows and cannot provide as much help or guidance as for Macs.   In my
experience people can install the software without too much difficulty, but
occasionally run into problems that require some knowledge of Windows to
resolve.

Once you have installed the server, restart your computer.  You should then be
able to create a database connection with Workbench (or Navicat, which ever
you've installed).
-   Open Workbench
-   Click "Open Connection to Start Querying".   You will have to provide a
    name for the connection, anything will do.
-   A dialog box ("Connect to Database") opens.  Click "OK".  A window titled
    "MySQL Workbench", with a tab labeled "SQL Editor 0", should open.
-   At this point you can setup the sample database we'll be using in class.
    Please see the instructions and files in the directory data.

If you have trouble, please contact me and I'll help as best I can.


LINUX
-----
MySQL is installed by default on many Linux distributions.  If it isn't on
yours, instructions for installation are available at

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/linux-installation.html


DATA INSTALLATION
=================
Once you have the server running you will probably want to load it with the
data we will use in class.  Please go to the directory data/ packaged with
these instructions and follow the instructions in the file "DATA_INSTALLATION".


SOME EXPLANATORY NOTES
----------------------

If you are interested, here is some discussion of what's going on with these
softwares.

MySQL Workbench (and Navicat, or any MySQL client) provides a graphic
"front-end" for connecting to a MySQL database program, either locally (e.g.,
on the same computer as the software) or remotely (over a network).  It is very
useful for making and managing those connections, and provides tools for
writing and running queries, and handling their output.  It is NOT the database
software.

Thus the requirement for installing MySQL server.  This installation puts a
database program on your computer so Workbench can find and connect to it.
Workbench talks to the database program and handles its output, the database
does the actual query-crunching.

MySQL Server is different from programs like Excel or Firefox in that it is a
"server".  It is not intended to be used directly, and doesn't have an
interface for receiving commands from a human computer user.  Instead it
provides "services" to other programs -- they can send it commands and get
responses from it.  Workbench is such a program: it sends commands to MySQL,
receives its output in response to those commands, and displays that output to
the user.  

This "server" status also drives the requirement for installing the startup
script for MySQL Server.  It doesn't provide an icon through which you can
launch it.  It is possible to start the server for yourself, but (on Mac) this
involves using a command-line interface and about fifteen commands.

Caveat: Be careful generalizing the above to other tools running SQL queries.
The above applies to MySQL Server and Workbench.  SQL is a language standard,
and there are many tools for using it.  SQL queries can be run in Microsoft
Access, Navicat, SQLite -- it's a long list.  How these tools implement the
standard may vary from the architecture described above for MySQL.
